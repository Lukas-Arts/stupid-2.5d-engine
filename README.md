# stupid-2.5d-engine

This is a stupid 2.5d-Engine im made a while ago for educational reasons.
It's stupid, mainly because everything runs on the CPU :D 

But it works.

I actually used this to reverse engineer the 1995 released [Ascendancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascendancy_(video_game)) Game. You can read more about that in my [Blog](https://blog.1ynx.de/post/?id=cc8c5f0f-02af-4d56-9369-66dd5e07a182). 

TestPanel1 was actually a test interpretation for the Solar-System-View of the game, with different test assets.

TestPanel2 is a simple spinning Galaxy
